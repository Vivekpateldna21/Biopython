# Biopython
Biopython Project Description
This project is a mini automated bioinformatics pipeline developed using Python and BioPython.
It performs end-to-end biological sequence analysis starting from sequence input to BLAST result interpretation.
The pipeline is designed in a modular format, where each step is implemented as a separate Python script and later integrated as a complete workflow.

**Objectives**
To automate biological sequence analysis
To understand practical usage of BioPython
To perform sequence validation, analysis, ORF detection, and BLAST verification
To build a beginner-friendly bioinformatics tool
